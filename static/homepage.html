<!-- 
homepage.html, the first page displayed when running the website
Full project also have other HTML files, e.g. 
- profile.html, having a default profile page structure/styles, while also having ability to receive and display user-provided HTML file for profile customization
- matchups.html, displaying the page of leagues and matchups, maybe a button per team to submit a pick
- leaderboards.html, displaying the top X users on the Ranked and Streak leaderboards with links to their profiles (both leaderboards on one page?)

        TODO: Implement links to league matchups.
        I'm thinking, it should be done as a "submit" button for each league, and use handlebars to:
        - process the button's id pressed
        - link to matchups; should file paths be be views/matchups/<league>.handlebars?
        - pull from only the corresponding league's DB branch 
        - print each matchup of the day accordingly with a {{each }} function
        - have a navigation back to homepage with league selection
