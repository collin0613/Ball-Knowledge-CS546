<!-- 
matchups.html, displaying the page of leagues and matchups, maybe a button per team to submit a pick
Full project also have other HTML files, e.g. 
- homepage.html, the first page displayed when running the website
- profile.html, having a default profile page structure/styles, while also having ability to receive and display user-provided HTML file for profile customization
- leaderboards.html, displaying the top X users on the Ranked and Streak leaderboards with links to their profiles (both leaderboards on one page?)
